Building a simple KNN model for the healthcare dataset from ANOVA insurance

Anova Insurance, a global health insurance company, seeks to optimize its insurance policy premium pricing based on the health status of applicants. Understanding an applicant's health condition is crucial for two key decisions:
 - Determining eligibility for health insurance coverage. 
 - Deciding on premium rates, particularly if the applicant's health indicates higher risks. 

The objective is to Develop a predictive model that utilizes health data to classify individuals as 'healthy' or 'unhealthy'. This classification will assist in making informed decisions about insurance policy premium pricing.
